  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>At Rejoice Institute House, our vision is to be the bridge for new and established writers to reach their audience without navigating complex contracts or agreements. We provide a platform for authors without financial means to publish their work, and for those with abundant content who need a place to share it. We close the gap and stress of publishing by making it simple and accessible. More than a publishing house, we are an institute: a place to complete incomplete pieces, exchange ideas, and learn the craft of writing and publishing.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to survive and thrive for decades, spreading the freedom of creative expression through books, poetry, journals, letters, drawings, paintings, and even love poetry. Rejoice Institute House is a second home for creatives—a place of art, encouragement, and inspiration. We want every writer to experience the gift of free expression and to share it with the world.</p>

Think of this as a marketplace for creatives, where your art can flourish and reach its audience.</p>
